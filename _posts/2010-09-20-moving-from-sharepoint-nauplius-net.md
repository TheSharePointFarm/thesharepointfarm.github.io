title: Moving from SharePoint.Nauplius.Net

So due to money issues (aka giving up a quarter rack to hold some ancient 32-bit servers), Iâ€™ve moved the SharePoint blog to blogspot.com.  It seems to even work better with Windows Live Writer than Windows SharePoint Services did!

I apologize for the inconvenience the lack of good linking has caused, but you should be able to find everything from the old blog here.  The dates are not quite right (I just reposted what was in WLW drafts).

Any links to http://sharepoint.nauplius.net should redirect to the main page here.

Thanks for reading!
