[MS12-050](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms12-050) was released today.  It covers InfoPath (client), WSSv3, MOSS 2007, Groove, Groove Server, SharePoint Foundation 2010 (RTM and SP1), SharePoint Server 2010 (RTM and SP1), and Office Web Applications (RTM and SP1).

Make sure you install all applicable patches for your product.  For instance, for SharePoint Server 2010 SP1 with Office Web Applications SP1, this means 3 patches: KB2553424, KB2553194, and KB2598239.

If you are running the latest June 2012 CU on SharePoint 2010 SP1, the SharePoint 2010 SP1 patches in MS12-050 do not apply.

After installation and any applicable reboots, do not forget to run the SharePoint Products Configuration Wizard to fully configure these patches.
