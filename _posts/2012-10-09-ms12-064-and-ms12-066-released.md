[MS12-064](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms12-064) and [MS12-066](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms12-066) have been released.  These affect both SharePoint Server 2010 SP1 as well as Office Web Apps 2010 SP1.  After installation on all SharePoint Servers in your farm, do not forget to run the Config Wizard on each server.

It does appear that MS12-064 is contained within the August 2012 Cumulative Update for SharePoint Server 2010.

A Microsoft FAST Search Server 2010 security update was also released today: [MS12-067](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms12-067).
