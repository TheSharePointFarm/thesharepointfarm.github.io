Iâ€™m releasing the final version of my BlobCache solution for SharePoint 2010.  You can find it [here](http://blobcache.codeplex.com/releases/view/96995).  This release has some UI fixes from the previous version, as well as fixing a bug here or there.  This solution allows you to modify the web.config of the target Web Application via a Central Administration UI.

Please leave feedback [here](http://blobcache.codeplex.com/discussions) or message me on Twitter.
