Looks like the KB article outlining the no support statement for SharePoint 2010 running on Windows Server 2012 has been updated to indicate that SharePoint 2010 will be supported on Windows Server 2012 when SharePoint 2010 Service Pack 2 is released.

See [KB2724471](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2724471) for details.
