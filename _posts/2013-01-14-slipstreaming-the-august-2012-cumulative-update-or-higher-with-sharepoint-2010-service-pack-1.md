title: Slipstreaming the August 2012 Cumulative Update or higher with SharePoint 2010 Service Pack 1
tags: [sp2010]

After contacting PSS, Microsoft has determined that slipstreaming of the August 2012 Cumulative Update or higher into SharePoint 2010 with Service Pack 1 is a bug, however because there is a valid workaround (using the slipstreamed SP1 install with or without the June 2012 Cumulative Update slipstreamed) the Product Group has not made a determination as to if/when this bug would be fixed.  If Service Pack 2 "fixes" this issue, I would doubt that the Product Group will attempt to resolve the Cumulative Update slipstream issue as presented by the August 2012 CU and above.
