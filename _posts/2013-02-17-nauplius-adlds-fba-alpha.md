title: Nauplius.ADLDS.FBA Alpha
tags: [ad-lds,news,sp2010]

I've released an alpha of my Nauplius.ADLDS.FBA for SharePoint 2010.  This solution assists in the provisioning of a forms based authentication configuration for Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services and Active Directory Application Mode.  Testing on multi-server farms is highly appreciated (to validate the SecurityTokenServices' web.config is properly handled), but do keep in mind that this is an alpha, so keep the testing to development and UAT farms.

Please post any issues found in the [solution's discussion forums](http://sharepointadlds.codeplex.com/discussions).

You can find installation and configuration details on the [solution's download page](http://sharepointadlds.codeplex.com/releases/view/102066).
