Quickly after releasing the alpha build, I'm releasing a 1.0 version of the Nauplius.ADLDS.Provider Ldap Membership and Role provider targeted specifically for SharePoint Foundation.

Please review the [documentation](http://sharepointadlds.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Nauplius.ADLDS.Provider&referringTitle=Documentation) page for this project.  It can be downloaded [here](http://sharepointadlds.codeplex.com/releases/view/102948).  Installation has changed from a manual installation to an MSI that will automatically install the DLL for you in the GAC.

Please report any bugs or issues in the [discussions](http://sharepointadlds.codeplex.com/discussions) page.  Feedback is also highly welcome!
