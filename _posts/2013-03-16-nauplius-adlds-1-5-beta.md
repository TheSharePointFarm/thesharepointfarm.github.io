I'm releasing a beta of my AD LDS project that now incorporates the old [Nauplius AD LDS User Profile Import]({% post_url 2012-05-15-nauplius-ad-lds-user-profile-import-1-0-released %}) as well as the alpha Nauplius.ADLDS.FBA project.

The new [Nauplius.ADLDS.FBA 1.5](http://sharepointadlds.codeplex.com/releases/view/103479) solution allows the administrator to easily provision an AD LDS provider against a Web Application, keeping all web.configs required consistent across the farm.  In addition, the solution will pull in key User Profile properties from the configured AD LDS instance into the User Profile Service.

Please see the project's [Documentation](http://sharepointadlds.codeplex.com/documentation).  Any [Discussions](http://sharepointadlds.codeplex.com/discussions) or [Bugs](http://sharepointadlds.codeplex.com/workitem/list/basic) are welcome!
