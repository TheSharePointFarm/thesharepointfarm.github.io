In addition to previous improvements found in [1.5 beta](http://thesharepointfarm.com/nauplius-adlds-1-5-beta/), [Nauplius.ADLDS.FBA 1.6](https://sharepointadlds.codeplex.com/releases/view/105172) for AD LDS configuration and User Profile import now supports non-Default zones!  Other improvements include moving the Security Token Service timer job and health check rule to an Application Server package as well as leveraging the Lists web service.  Lots of other minor fixes!
