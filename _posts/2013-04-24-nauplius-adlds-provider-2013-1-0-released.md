This is a straight port of the [previous AD LDS provider]({% post_url 2013-03-04-nauplius-adlds-provider-1-0-released %}) for SharePoint Foundation 2010. This provider allows SharePoint Foundation administrators to connect to an LDAP-based directory service.

Please review the [documentation](http://sharepointadlds.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Nauplius.ADLDS.Provider&referringTitle=Documentation) page for this project.  It can be downloaded [here](https://sharepointadlds.codeplex.com/releases/view/105625).  Installation has changed from a manual installation to an MSI that will automatically install the DLL for you in the GAC.

Please report any bugs or issues in the [discussions](http://sharepointadlds.codeplex.com/discussions) page.  Feedback is also highly welcome!
