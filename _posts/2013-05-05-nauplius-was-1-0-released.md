I've released Nauplius.WAS 1.0 to CodePlex.  This release includes many improvements over the previous versions, including UI and functionality improvements, as well as bug fixes.

Nauplius.WAS allows a user to interact with SharePoint's Word Automation Services functionality, allowing a user to easily convert a document from one file type to another using a simple, ribbon-based UI.
