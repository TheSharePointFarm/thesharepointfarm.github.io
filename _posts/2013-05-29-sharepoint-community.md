I've been involved in a (relatively) new community, [SharePoint Community](http://sharepoint-community.net/).  Started by [Mark Jones](http://sharepoint-community.net/profile/markjones) and [Vlad Catrinescu](http://sharepoint-community.net/profile/vladcatrinescu), SharePoint-Community.Net offers a place for SharePoint users of all types, from beginners to business users to experts, and everyone in between, to communicate, collaborate, work together, and socialize.  Currently the community is composed of over 1,200 members from all over the world and growing every day.  In addition to discussions and chat, SharePoint-Community has weekly giveaways for members (it's free!), all you have to do is participate.  If you get a few minutes, come by and say 'hi' in the chat, or leave your thoughts on the current state of SharePoint, or perhaps let us know who your [SharePoint Hero](http://sharepoint-community.net/forum/topics/who-do-you-learn-sharepoint-from) is!
