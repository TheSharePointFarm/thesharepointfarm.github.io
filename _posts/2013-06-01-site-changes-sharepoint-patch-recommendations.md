title: Site Changes â€“ SharePoint Patch Recommendations
tags: [news]
---

I've made a few changes to SharePoint.Nauplius.net over the past week or so.  I've acquired a new theme, and even designed myself a (mini) logo.

More so than the visual changes to the site, I wanted to bring your attention to the "**Recommended Current Patch Level**" widget on the left hand side.  This is my personal recommendation, based on what I've seen with the patch from my own testing, along with various other sources...  It is not a guarantee you will not have issues with the specific patch level!  You should always test patches in a pre-production environment that closely mirrors your production environment, testing all facets of business critical SharePoint functionality that you're realistically able to.  I will not be including Security Patches with the widget (for example, MS13-035), as I always recommend you deploy security patches as soon as possible.
