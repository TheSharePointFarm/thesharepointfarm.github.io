title: SharePoint 2010 June 2013 Cumulative Update â€¦ Is SP2 Around the Corner?
tags: [sp2010]
---

Many of the primary binaries of the June 2013 Cumulative Update have a build number of 14.0.7xxx.1000.  The last available SharePoint 2010 SP2 Public Beta build numbers were in the same range.  For example, Microsoft.SharePoint.Portal.dll SP2 Public Beta has a build number of 14.0.7010.1000 and the Microsoft.SharePoint.Portal.dll June 2013 Cumulative Update has a build build number of 14.0.7011.1000.

Microsoft has reserved the .1000 builds for Service Packs in the past (.5000 series for Cumulative Updates).

It looks like we may be nearing SharePoint 2010 SP2 release!
