Analogies are essential to explaining SharePoint, especially to non-technical users.  I’ve always expressed that “SharePoint is a platform”, but what does a platform mean, and why would an end user care about “a platform” (after all, they typically interact with only a few bits of it)?  After all of these years, Microsoft has finally attempted to reach out to the business community and end user (without having to involve IT with the Productivity Hub) via [www.discoversharepoint.com](http://www.discoversharepoint.com/).  Here is an analogy to explain Web Applications, Site Collections, and Webs:

The Web Application is the apartment building with one or more floors.

The Site Collection is the (secure) floor with one or more apartments.

The Web is the apartment.

Going further…

A Library is like a bookshelf in the apartment.

A List is like an organizational container in the apartment.

Expand from here!  What are your analogies for end users and executive management?
