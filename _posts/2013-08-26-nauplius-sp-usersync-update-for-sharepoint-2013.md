title: Nauplius.SP.UserSync â€“ Update for SharePoint 2013
tags: [development,news,sp2010,sp2013]

If you, or your company, loves SharePoint Foundation, this project is for you!  I have updated the Nauplius.SP.UserSync project with various bug fixes, ULS logging, and best of all, SharePoint Foundation 2013 support!  This solution consists of a timer job that updates the User Information List of each Site Collection from Active Directory on a nightly basis.

The downloads are available from the [Nauplius.SP.UserSync releases](https://foundationsync.codeplex.com/releases) page.
