A new version of the AD LDS provider has been released for SharePoint 2010 and 2013.  This release includes numerous bug fixes.  Uninstall the previous version and restart.  Install the new version and restart a second time.  This is to prevent a cached copy of the DLL from being used, as well as making sure all processes pick up the new DLL.

Both the SharePoint 2010 and 2013 versions can be downloaded from the [SharePoint ADLDS Releases](https://sharepointadlds.codeplex.com/releases) page.
