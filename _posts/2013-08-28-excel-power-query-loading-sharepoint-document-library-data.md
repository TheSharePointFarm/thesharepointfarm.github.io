title: Excel Power Query â€“ Loading SharePoint Document Library Data
tags: [sp2010,sp2013]

With [Excel Power Query](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel/download-microsoft-power-query-for-excel-FX104018616.aspx), you can query SharePoint List data quickly and easily, as well as a variety of other types of data sources.

However, when we do this, only SharePoint Lists appear!  This is not helpful if, for instance, you have property promotion from an InfoPath form into a Document Library that you want to query.

To work around this, we simply need to show the Formula Bar, which can be found in the Query Editor window under Settings.

Next, edit the query to show all Contents of the SharePoint site.  Once we change `=SharePoint.Tables("http://url")` to `=SharePoint.Contents("http://url")`, click the Refresh button and all Document Libraries will appear!

The other valid value for the SharePoint query type is `=SharePoint.Files("http://url")`.  With this type, all uploaded files on the SharePoint site will be displayed.

There is a 4th query type, SharePoint.Count, which is ignored in the Power Query assemblies.
