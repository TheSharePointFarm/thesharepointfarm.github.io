title: Speaking at SharePoint Saturday Redmond

If you happen to be in the Redmond, WA area on September 21st, come to SharePoint Saturday Redmond!  I will have two ‘lightning’ sessions and will be introducing the SharePoint Connector for Forefront Identity Manager (now in Release Candidate status) as well as leveraging the IIS Application Routing Request module with SharePoint, both topics I’ve detailed here on this blog.

It should be a lot of fun, come join us!  If you do happen to be local and would also like to volunteer at SPS Red, I’m looking for about 10 people to help out at the event with various assignments.  Please contact me via the [contact form](http://thesharepointfarm.com/contact/) if you’re interested in volunteering.  We need people to handle registration, sponsor setup and tear down, as well as room monitors.

You can get your free tickets for SPS Red from the [spsevents.org](http://spsevents.org/city/Redmond/SPSRed2013/Pages/Home.aspx) site.
