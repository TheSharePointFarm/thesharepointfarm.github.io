I spoke recently at SharePoint Saturday Redmond 2013 about leveraging Forefront Identity Manager in place of the User Profile Synchronization Service (and other Profile import methods). Below are the slides.

Further information about this topic can be found on my blog at Using an External Identity Manager for SharePoint User Profile Synchronization.  The SharePoint Connector, currently in Release Candidate status, can be found at [Microsoft Connect](https://connect.microsoft.com/).

This was my first speaking opportunity and was quite fun!  Thanks to everyone that came to see this (short and demo-heavy) presentation.  I plan on future talks at the Puget Sound SharePoint Users Group.
