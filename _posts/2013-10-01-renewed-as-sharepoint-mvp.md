Today I was renewed as a SharePoint Server MVP for the 2nd year.  I appreciate everyoneâ€™s support and am honored to be re-awarded.  You can find more about the MVP Program at the [Microsoft Most Valuable Professional](http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/default.aspx) site as well as at the [MVP Award Blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/mvpawardprogram/archive/2013/10/01/new-and-renewed-mvps-announced.aspx).
