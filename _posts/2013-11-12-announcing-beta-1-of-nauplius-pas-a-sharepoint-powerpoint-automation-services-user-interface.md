title: Announcing Beta 1 of Nauplius.PAS â€“ A SharePoint PowerPoint Automation Services User Interface
tags: [development,news,sp2013]
---

Like the counterpart [Nauplius.WAS](https://was.codeplex.com/releases), [Nauplius.PAS](https://pas.codeplex.com/releases), for SharePoint Server 2013, is a user interface for the PowerPoint Automation Services.  Currently in Beta 1, this farm solution provides a user interface to leverage the PowerPoint Automation Services API.  Currently, the interface is limited to selecting one or more documents in a Document Library for conversion.  Future builds will add folder conversion and workflow support.

Please leave any feedback in the [Discussions](https://pas.codeplex.com/discussions) or any bugs/problems in the [Issues](https://pas.codeplex.com/workitem/list/basic) tab on CodePlex.  Also, review the [Documentation](https://pas.codeplex.com/documentation) for PowerPoint Automation Services as it does require PowerShell to set up, along with possible NTFS folder permission modification on the SharePoint Server(s) running the PowerPoint Automation Services service instance.
