tags: [development,news,sp2010,sp2013]
---

Nauplius.SharePoint.BlobCache is a SharePoint 2010 and 2013 solution that helps you manage the BLOB cache and all available settings, both documented and undocumented. New with this release is a re-vamped UI, moving to the Web Application list menu in Central Administration. In addition, the 2013 version adds support for two new 2013-only BLOB cache attributes:

* imageRenditionMaxFileSize
* imageRenditionMaxSourcePixels


The new UI can be found under Central Administration, Manage Web Applications.  Simply highlight the desired Web Application, then click the BLOB Cache button in the Manage group.
