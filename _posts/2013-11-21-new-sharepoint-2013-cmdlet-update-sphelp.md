title: New SharePoint 2013 Cmdlet - Update-SPHelp
tags: [sp2013]
---

`Update-SPHelp` is a new PowerShell cmdlet that shipped with the October 2013 Cumulative Update for SharePoint 2013.  There are only a couple of options with it, namely the -Force parameter allowing you to check for updates more than once per 24 hours, but the cmdlet is similar to Update-Help, that is, update the cmdlet help information.
