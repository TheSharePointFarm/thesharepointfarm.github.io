title: Become a Rockstar!

There is this cool startup named [Rockstar 365](http://rockstar365.com/) that helps people find Microsoft technology specialists, kind of like a LinkedIn for Microsoft without all of the 'social'. It can help you keep track of your projects as well as Microsoft certifications, and hopefully soon events and articles you've authored. Go to my [Rockstar Profile](http://rockstar365.com/NaupliusTrevor) to see an example of how it works. In addition, they've just launched Company pages! They have a free tier, which you can see the profile I created for [Nauplius](http://rockstar365.com/nauplius) as well as paid tiers.

Hopefully this will let you get a little more exposure to companies as well as have some fun with the ranking system. Hopefully they'll implement a system to bring in your MSDN/TechNet profile and rank it, that would be an awesome feature :-)
