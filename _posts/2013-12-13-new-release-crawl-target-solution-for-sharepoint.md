title: New Release - Crawl Target Solution for SharePoint
tags: [development,news,sp2013]
---

Based on my previous [post]({% post_url 2013-12-02-targeting-the-search-crawler-to-a-specific-server %}) regarding targeting a crawler at a specific server running the Foundation Web service, I have built a Central Administration-UI to allow SharePoint Administrators to do this with ease. Currently, this solution is SharePoint 2013-only, but I will be back porting it to SharePoint 2010 in the near future.

You can find the download and more about the project at the CodePlex site, [SharePoint Crawl Target](https://crawl.codeplex.com/).
