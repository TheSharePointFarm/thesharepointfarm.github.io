Yesterday I spoke at the [Puget Sound SharePoint User Group](http://psspug.org/SitePages/Home.aspx) about Word Automation Services and PowerPoint Automation Services. Below are the slides.

In addition, the demos used on the slides were completed in SharePoint 2013 using [Nauplius.WAS](http://thesharepointfarm.com/portfolio/nauplius-was/) and [Nauplius.PAS](http://thesharepointfarm.com/portfolio/nauplius-pas/), both freely available from [CodePlex.com](https://www.codeplex.com/site/users/view/TrevorSeward).
