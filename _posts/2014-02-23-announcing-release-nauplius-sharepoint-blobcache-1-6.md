title: Announcing the Release of Nauplius.SharePoint.BlobCache 1.6
tags: [development,news,sp2010,sp2013]

Nauplius.SharePoint.BlobCache is a SharePoint 2010 and 2013 solution that helps you manage the BLOB cache and all available settings, both documented and undocumented. New with this release is a bug fix for SharePoint 2010 and SharePoint 2013 to resolve an issue where the solution would not function if the Foundation Web Service was not running on the server with Central Administration (thanks, [@brianlala](https://twitter.com/brianlala)!). This release also resolves an issue where previous settings were not removed with each use of the solution.
