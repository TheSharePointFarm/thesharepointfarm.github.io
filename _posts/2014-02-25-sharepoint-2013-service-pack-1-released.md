SharePoint 2013 Service Pack 1 has been released. Note that while Service Pack 1 does support Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012 R2 support requires a new SharePoint 2013 with Service Pack 1 ISO to be released. Slipstreaming or installing RTM and then SP1 on Server 2012 R2 is not supported. This post has been updated with the re-release of Service Pack 1.
