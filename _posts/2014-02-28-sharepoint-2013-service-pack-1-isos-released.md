title: SharePoint 2013 with Service Pack 1 ISOs Released
tags: [sp2013]

Microsoft has released the SharePoint 2013 with Service Pack 1 ISOs (including Project Server  and Office Web Apps). These ISOs are required for Windows Server 2012 R2 support as it includes an updated prerequisite installer, which does not ship with the normal Service Pack binary.

The new ISOs are available via MSDN Subscriptions and while I do not have access, likely the Volume License center as well.
