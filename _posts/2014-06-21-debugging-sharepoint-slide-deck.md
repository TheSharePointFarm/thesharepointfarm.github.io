I presented Debugging SharePoint at the June [Puget Sound SharePoint Users Group](http://psspug.org/SitePages/Home.aspx) last Thursday. Below is the slide deck from the presentation. Yes, we had a few Microsoft employees present and live debugging sessions ;-) In addition to the slides, I have an [article]() on this topic which I will be updating soon to include new, expanded content with additional tips from this presentation.
