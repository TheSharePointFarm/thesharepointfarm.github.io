Timeouts, especially unknown timeouts, can cause a lot of headaches. So I've started compiling SharePoint default timeouts in the "current" version of SharePoint (that is to say, I'll do my best effort to keep it up-to-date).

[SharePoint Default Timeouts](/_posts/sharepoint-default-timeouts)

The Excel sheet can be found under the SharePoint Resources link, feel free to download and borrow it as needed :-) If there are any timeouts that should be added, let me know by via [Twitter](https://thesharepointfarm.com/wp-admin/twitter.com/NaupliusTrevor).
