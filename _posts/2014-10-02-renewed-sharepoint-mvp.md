So I'm one day late, but yesterday I was renewed as a SharePoint MVP for the 3rd year. I'm extremely honored and grateful to be awarded! Lots of big plans for open source solutions this year, and more product reviews. You can find more about the MVP Program at the [Microsoft Most Valuable Professional](http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/default.aspx) site as well as at the [MVP Award Blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/mvpawardprogram/archive/2014/10/01/congratulations-to-all-the-new-and-renewed-mvps.aspx).
