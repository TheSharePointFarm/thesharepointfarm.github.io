The April 2015 CU, MS15-033, and MS15-036 require SharePoint 2013 Build #15.0.4571.1502. Here is a list of where you can get that patch, if you've patched with either the "bad" SP1 or if you've leveraged the slipstreamed SP1 from the MSDN/VLSC downloads, which are required for Server 2012 R2 support.

SharePoint Foundation 2013 Service Pack 1: <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42548>

SharePoint Server 2013 Service Pack 1: <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42544>

Project Server 2013 Service Pack 1: <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42545>

SharePoint Foundation 2013 Language Packs Service Pack 1: <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42546>

SharePoint Server 2013 Language Packs Service Pack 1: <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42543>

When the good Service Pack 1 has been installed, each major component will display build 15.0.4571.1502.
