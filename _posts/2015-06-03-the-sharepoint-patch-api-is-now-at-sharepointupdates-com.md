The SharePoint Patch API is now at [sharepointupdates.com](https://sharepointupdates.com)! This will hopefully make the service easier to discover and use. All existing URLs will redirect, so there is no requirement to change any API functionality. This includes the `Get-SPPatchInfo` and `Get-SPPatch` cmdlets; they'll continue to function.

The SharePoint Patch API is designed to help you discover SharePoint patch information. The included PowerShell cmdlets also let you manage patch downloads and installations onto SharePoint servers, using the best practice methods to keep installation times to a minimum.

Feedback about the service is always welcome!
