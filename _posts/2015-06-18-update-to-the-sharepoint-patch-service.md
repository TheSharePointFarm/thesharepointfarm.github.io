There is a new update to the [SharePoint Patch Service](http://sharepointupdates.com/)! This update includes the following changes:

* [Jeff Jones](http://www.spjeff.com/) is supplying patch notes for SharePoint 2013 patches, starting with February 2015
* The [SharePoint Builds](http://sharepointupdates.com/Patches) page has been reorganized and updates to make it more useful. It now includes patch download links and Jeff's notes

An update to the PowerShell cmdlet will come later to provide access to Jeff's notes.
