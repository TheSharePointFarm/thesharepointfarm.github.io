[SharePointUpdates.com](https://sharepointupdates.com) provides you with information on SharePoint 2010, 2013, and next year, 2016 updates. Changes have been deployed today for the [Patches](http://sharepointupdates.com/Patches) and [Issues](http://sharepointupdates.com/Issues) pages. With the number of patches approaching 500, the list was becoming quite slow for IE 11 users. Due to this, the list is now paginated and should perform similarly across all browsers, including mobile devices. And speaking of mobile devices, the lists are now responsive! This should make it easy to review patch information from anywhere. Lastly, there are new export options -- just in case you want the data offline.

Let me know what you think!
