title: Discontinuing SharePoint 2010 Coverage â€“ SharePoint 2016 RTMs
tags: [news,sp2010,ps2010]

With the [release of SharePoint Server 2016](https://blogs.office.com/2016/03/14/sharepoint-2016-rtm-and-the-future-of-sharepoint-event/), I am discontinuing SharePoint/Project Server 2010 coverage. However, [SharePoint Updates](http://sharepointupdates.com/) will continue to be updated with any SharePoint 2010 patch. At this point, you should migrate to a newer platform anyhow.
