title: SharePoint Patch Build Numbers Module on GitHub

The [SharePoint Patch Build Numbers]({% post_url 2016-04-12-sharepoint-server-2016-patch-build-numbers-module %}) module is now on [GitHub](https://github.com/Nauplius/SharePointProductInformation). If you have any ideas for improving the module, let me know. This module will allow you to determine the current build. This is more important on SharePoint Server 2016 where the farm build number will (not often) change after a patch has been installed.
