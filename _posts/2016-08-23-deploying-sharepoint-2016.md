I wrote a book! Vlad Catrinescu and I spent many months writing on deploying SharePoint 2016. It's been an adventure, to say the least, hiding in my room writing on my laptop (when I could have been playing Guild Wars 2 instead). The process actually started at last year's MVP Summit in November; Vlad asked me to be a technical reviewer, but offered the chance to be a co-author instead. A few sticks 16GB ECC RDIMMs later (16, to be exact) and I had a fully functional SharePoint 2016 lab environment with all of the optional services one typically finds with SharePoint, including an Office 365 hybrid deployment.

The book is finally coming out, and I'm pretty excited! This book is targeted at those who are thinking about or are starting to plan their deployment of a SharePoint Server 2016 farm; it covers the SQL Server installation, too. There is a lot of PowerShell, a smattering use of Windows Server Core, Workflow Manager, and more!

Deploying SharePoint 2016 is geared towards the intermediate to advanced crowd, but of course those who are just beginning their journey with SharePoint Administration may find it interesting and learn a few things, plus you can always ask me questions on your deployment or contact me to set up a formal engagement.

You can purchase the book from [Amazon](http://amzn.to/2beE5yZ) or directly from our publisher, [APress](http://www.apress.com/9781484219980?gtmf=s), where it is also available in eBook format. At any rate, when it comes out I certainly hope you enjoy it and learn a thing or two on SharePoint Server 2016 deployments!
