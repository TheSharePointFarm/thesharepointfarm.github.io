title: Updated SharePoint Patch Script
tags: [sp2016]
---

As many SharePoint admins are aware, patching SharePoint typically isn't fun, and can be downright slow. Russ Maxwell introduced the "5 hour" SharePoint patch script. Awhile back I released a version compatible with SharePoint Server 2016 and now I've updated the "5 hour" SharePoint Patch Script on my GitHub repo. This script facilitates patching of SharePoint Server 2013 and SharePoint Server 2016. There are some bug fixes and cosmetic issues worked out in this release. In addition, this release no longer stops nor starts services when patching SharePoint Server 2016. SharePoint Server 2016 patches take care of this process for us.
