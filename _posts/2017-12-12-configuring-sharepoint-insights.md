Have you tried configuring SharePoint Insights and run across this error?

The solution for this is quite easy. Run a Command Prompt as administrator (cmd.exe or powershell.exe will do), navigate to the shortcut to where the Microsoft SharePoint Hybrid Configuration Wizard resides (your desktop), then run the following.

```powershell
".\Microsoft SharePoint Hybrid Configuration Wizard.appref-ms"
```

After that, going through the wizard allows you to successfully complete the SharePoint Insights configuration. As weâ€™re calling the SharePoint OM, we need to run the Hybrid Configuration Wizard elevated in order for it to succeed.
