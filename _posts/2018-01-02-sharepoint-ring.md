Have a problem with hex values? Can't figure out what that Permission Mask ULS entry really means? Need to know what action was last taken on a file but forgot to enable audit logging? If so, [SharePoint Ring](https://sharepointring.com/) is the site for you! This is a new tool designed to allow you to translate various hex values into their textual value for further investigation (and no, nothing decodes to "Be sure to drink your Ovaltine").

All you need to do is grab the hex value from the source log or database, choose the correct decoder from the Masks menu, then input the value.

As always, feedback is welcome, as is additional requests for functionality. I will be adding various value types in the future to decode, but I wanted to get a sense of the use of this tool in the mean time.
