title: Bing Wallpaper Script

I frequently enjoy the Bing Wallpaper from Bing.com. This script allows you to automatically set the wallpaper image via script. There are two options, a VBScript Scheduled Task which I recommend and a PowerShell Scheduled Task which also works, but will open up a PowerShell window briefly every hour. Instructions are on the GitHub repo.
