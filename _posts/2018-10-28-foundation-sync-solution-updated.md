To recap, the SharePoint Foundation Sync solution is a SharePoint Foundation 2010 and 2013 solution designed to synchronize Active Directory accounts with User Information Lists. This includes pulling down pictures for users from Active Directory (thumbnailPhoto attribute) or Exchange 2013 or above.

The SharePoint Foundation Sync solution has been updated for SharePoint 2013. I have also brought the SharePoint 2010 version up to date with the 2013 version, something that has been requested for quite some time. You can grab version 2.73 from the [Releases](https://github.com/Nauplius/FoundationSync/releases) page.
