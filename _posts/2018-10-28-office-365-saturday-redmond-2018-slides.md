Thanks to everyone who attended my session at Office 365 Saturday 2018, What's New in SharePoint Server 2019. It was a ton of fun and I appreciated the interactivity and questions. As requested, the slides are attached. Some of this won't make sense without context, so if you have questions on SharePoint Server 2019, feel free to ask! Best places to ask would be on [TechNet](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/sharepoint/en-US/home?forum=SP2019) or [Reddit](http://reddit.com/r/sharepoint).
