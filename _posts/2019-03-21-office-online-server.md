title: Office Online Server on Windows Server 2019

While the latest release of Office Online Server came out post-Windows Server 2019, it now looks like the product group has no plans to support Office Online Server with Windows Server 2019. That is a bit of a disappointment as Windows Server 2016 has some issues, a big one being the time it takes to install Windows Updates. Jason Haak confirmed this on a [GitHub comment](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/OfficeDocs-OfficeOnlineServer/issues/33#issuecomment-474607052).

What does this mean for the future on-prem releases of SharePoint? I don't know, but I can only ask that we some day be able to hook in and consume the cloud-based Office Online, further enhancing a hybrid story. This would go a long ways to fixing the licensing restriction preventing the deployment of Office Online Server to Azure and other cloud providers.
