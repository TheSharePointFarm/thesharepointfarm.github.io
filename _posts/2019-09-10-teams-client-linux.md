title: Microsoft Teams is Coming to Linux
tags: [teams]
---

The Microsoft Teams client is coming to Linux! This is great news and will allow Microsoft to have the widest operating system coverage on desktop and mobile. As most people who follow Microsoft closely are likely aware, Windows is no longer one of the top performing products in Microsoft's portfolio and Microsoft's focus has shifted to services such as Azure and Office 365. This shows in revenue as well as behavior -- we're seeing Linux releases for a variety of software, from SQL Server to VSCode and soon... Teams.

Teams has been usable on Linux for some time now through the browser, but there are limitations. A fully featured Teams client will be welcome to provide full media features. While the Teams client is available on [Microsoft's official repository](https://packages.microsoft.com) as a deb package, don't get too excited -- you have to be invited to use the Linux client :-(

While I still use Windows 10 as a daily driver, primarily due to gaming and .NET Framework development, Linux has been attractive as a desktop option for quite some time now. Client applications like this enable people to choose their operating system of choice.

I'll be looking forward to the day Chromium Edge and Office come to Linux!
