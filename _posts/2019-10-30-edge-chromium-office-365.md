[Microsoft Edge Chromium](https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/) is the newest browser from Microsoft. Currently in development, Edge Chromium has a brand new feature in the Canary release that integrates with Azure AD and Office 365. If you log into your computer with an Azure AD account, Edge Chromium will automatically detect and sign you into Edge with your Azure AD account.

In addition, Edge Chromium now offers an Office 365 start page based on the account used in the Edge profile in addition to the Bing start page you see today with Microsoft Edge.

This allows for easy access to Microsoft Search (log into Bing.com first with your Office 365 account), recent e-mail, files, and more in Office 365 -- and as you can see below, even SharePoint on-premises files when you have configured hybrid OneDrive for Business!

Finally, it will even import your profile picture that you've uploaded to Office 365 and display it in the Edge Chromium toolbar.

I encourage enterprises who currently may have an investment in Internet Explorer 11 or Google Chrome to take a hard look at Edge Chromium. It has the enterprise features that Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge previously for offered via [Enterprise State Roaming](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/devices/enterprise-state-roaming-faqs) while improving integration with the Microsoft 365 ecosystem.

You can download the Edge Canary today at the [Microsoft Edge Insider Channels](https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/download).
