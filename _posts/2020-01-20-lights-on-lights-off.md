Welcome to a new color theme (have to keep up with SharePoint Online!) and feel free to turn the lights on, or the lights off! I've implemented the Google Chrome Labs' [dark-mode-toggle](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/dark-mode-toggle) project with some Office UI Fabric icons for that extra SharePoint-y feeling.

The site should follow your system-wide color scheme (for the Windows 10 1909 folks, let me [know](https://twitter.com/NaupliusTrevor) if it works on modern macOS) -- 
I did verify it works in Safari for iOS. The site will also save your choice, should you want to adjust to a color scheme other than what you use for your system.

If you find any contrast in dark mode difficult to read for any element, let me know so I can look at adjustments!

This also means the (official) end of Internet Explorer 11 support! But modern Firefox, Chrome, and Edge Chromium are fully compatible.

I hope you enjoy :-)
