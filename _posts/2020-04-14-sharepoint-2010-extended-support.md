Microsoft has [announced](https://aka.ms/SharePoint/server/2010/supportextension) that they are extending the end of support for SharePoint 2010 from October 13, 2020 to April 13th, 2021. This gives you an extra six months to plan that migration from 2010 to SharePoint 2019 or SharePoint Online! Note that this only applies to:

* SharePoint Foundation 2010
* SharePoint Server 2010
* Project Server 2010

Note that this does _not_ apply to the following products, which will end of life on October 13th, 2020:

* FAST Search Server 2010
* Microsoft Search Server 2010 Express
* Office Web Apps 2010

During this additional six months, SharePoint 2010 products will continue to receive extended support via product support services and monthly security updates.
