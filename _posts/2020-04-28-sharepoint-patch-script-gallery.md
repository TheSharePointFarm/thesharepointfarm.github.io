The [SharePoint Patch Script](https://github.com/Nauplius/SharePoint-Patch-Script) has been published to the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/SharePointPatchScript). Now you can run `Install-Module SharePointPatchScript` from PowerShell instead of downloading it from GitHub! Hopefully everyone find this a convenient way to download and keep the module up-to-date.

Enjoy!
