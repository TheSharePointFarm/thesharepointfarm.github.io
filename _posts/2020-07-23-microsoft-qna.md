title: Microsoft Q&A Replacing SharePoint TechNet/MSDN Forums
tags: [sp2019]
---

The TechNet/MSDN SharePoint forums are on their way out and being replaced by the [Microsoft Q&A discussion boards](https://docs.microsoft.com/answers/).

The current schedule for retirement of the SharePoint TechNet/MSDN forums is:

- As of this post, you can post in either TechNet/MSDN forums or Microsoft Q&A.
- July 27th, 2020 through August 10th, 2020 you can continue to comment, propose or mark answers, and vote on posts in the SharePoint TechNet/MSDN forums. For new posts, you must use Microsoft Q&A.
- August 10th, 2020 onward the SharePoint TechNet/MSDN forums will be read only.

Microsoft Q&A is a bit more like the StackExchange network in terms of functionality, that is, less of a classic forum experience with a back-and-forth discussion instead favoring the Q&A style of discussion where each top-level comment can be marked as an answer and (potential) answers can be replied to in a threaded format. For technical content where one needs to tease out details prior to answering, this isn't the best format for non-developer questions, in my personal opinion.

Microsoft Q&A does not use a forum-per product format. It instead uses tags for each discussion item. The tags I personally follow (so far) are:

- [office-sharepoint-online](https://docs.microsoft.com/answers/topics/office-sharepoint-online.html)
- [office-sharepoint-server-administration](https://docs.microsoft.com/answers/topics/office-sharepoint-server-administration.html)
- [office-sharepoint-server-customization](https://docs.microsoft.com/answers/topics/office-sharepoint-server-customization.html)
- [office-sharepoint-server-development](https://docs.microsoft.com/answers/topics/office-sharepoint-server-search-itpro.html)
- [office-sharepoint-server-itpro](https://docs.microsoft.com/answers/topics/office-sharepoint-server-itpro.html)
- [office-sharepoint-server-search-itpro](https://docs.microsoft.com/answers/topics/office-sharepoint-server-search-itpro.html)

All of the Office-related content, including Office Client, Microsoft Teams, SharePoint Online/Server, and Exchange Online/Server content in Microsoft Q&A can be found at the [Office products page](https://docs.microsoft.com/answers/products/office).

See you on the forums!
