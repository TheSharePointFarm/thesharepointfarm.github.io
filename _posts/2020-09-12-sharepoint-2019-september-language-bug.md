title: SharePoint Server 2019 September 2020 Public Update Bug
tags: [sp2019]

For the SharePoint Server 2019 September 2020 language-specific update [KB4484504](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4484504/), there is an issue with non-English languages and Modern sites. On modern sites, the Site Contents and Command Bar in Lists/Libraries is not rendering. A case was opened and the bug was confirmed. 

My recommendation for non-English farms is to hold off on the September 2020 PUs for SharePoint Server 2019 at this time.
