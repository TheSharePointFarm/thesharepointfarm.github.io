SharePoint Server vNext has been briefly mentioned in an announcement, oddly enough, about Exchange Server vNext. Like Exchange Server vNext and Skype for Business Server vNext, SharePoint Server vNext will be based on a [subscription](https://youtu.be/aau9NazvdYY?t=841) model, similar to Microsoft 365.

Don't hold your breath until it is released, but get your Windows Servers prepped! And of course, as information comes out about vNext, I'll make sure to keep you updated here.
