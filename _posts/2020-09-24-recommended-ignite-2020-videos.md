title: Recommended Ignite 2020 Videos for Microsoft 365
tags: [news]

Most of Microsoft's Ignite content this year was pre-recorded due to COVID. You can find the videos at the [Virtual Hub](https://adoption.microsoft.com/virtual-hub/). The videos below focus on Microsoft Search, Microsoft 365 Groups, SharePoint Online, and networking in Microsoft 365.
