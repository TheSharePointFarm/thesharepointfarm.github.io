title: SharePoint Updates Service Update

Last week I updated [SharePoint Updates](https://sharepointupdates.com) from .NET Framework to .NET Core 3.1, preserving the feature set with a few minor UI changes. I'm looking for suggestions for new features you'd like to see. This includes UI/UX, the RESTful API, and any changes you'd like to see with the associated PowerShell module.

I'm also curious to how the community would like to approach retired knowledge base articles. It looks like many of the SharePoint 2010-era KBs have been removed from support.microsoft.com; their downloads likely have also been removed. Should I preserve those links for posterity or remove them from the entry in the SharePoint Updates service?

I've set up a new [SharePoint Updates](https://github.com/tseward/SharePointUpdates/issues) repository to handle any feedback you may have. You can of course contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NaupliusTrevor) if you don't have a GitHub account or want to message me privately.

I've also added a [GitHub Sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/tseward). Should you find any service, application, or script I develop useful, consider funding even at any level.

Thanks!
