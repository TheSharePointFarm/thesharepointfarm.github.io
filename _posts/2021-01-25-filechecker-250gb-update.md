[FileChecker](https://github.com/tseward/FileChecker/releases/tag/1.0.1), a .NET 5.0 console application for Linux, macOS, and Windows. FileChecker scans a folder and its contents for any rule violations prior to a migration to SharePoint Online or OneDrive for Business.

I've changed the maximum supported per-file size from 100GB to [250GB for SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-onedrive-blog/gain-more-flexibility-with-250-gb-file-size-support-in-microsoft/ba-p/1847728).

Leave any feedback or wants and wishes in the issues on the repo.
